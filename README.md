1. Start Django project to serve one static page.
2. Add Person model with name and email fields. Create form and a view to save new people to database. Use Postgres as database.
3. Add page listing all the Person models with filter form on top to search people by name and email.
4. Use your favourite JS framework to make the same filtered list on a separate page (use django rest framework to access database).
   **(unimplemented)**
5. Add docker compose file so the full app starts up with `docker-compose up`.
